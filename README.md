Badword

Description

We all know wordle, a game where you have to guess a random word with 5 letters. Badword is a similar one, but instead of having 5 letters and a normal word, you will have to guess a random Bad Bunny's song. The game ends when you dont guess the word or if you guess it.

MVP

a variable with many bad bunny's songs is creates

it creates a random word based on bad bunny's songs

for each letter in the word it creates a square

the player have to guess this word 

the player have 6 attemps to guess the song

if the player write a letter that its inside the word it will be a yellow letter

if the player write a letter thats its in the correct position it will be a green letter

if the player dont guess any letter it will remain the same, in grey color

if the player dont guess the song in the 6 attemps it will loose

if the player guess the song before the 6 attemps it will win

Backlog

restyle it

if you write one letter that is inside the word and its only once, only 
show one letter in yellow, not all of them, so you could know how many of them are in the word

style the keyboard so if you write one letter and its not in the word 

style it on grey and if its there style it on green

style the end screen
